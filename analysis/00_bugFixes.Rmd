## Introduction

```{r}

```


# loading modkit files in taking too long

* was using read.table()
* no wonder it was dying on bc1 - the file is 56G
* install data.table and try that instead - far more efficient for large datasets
* ran a 9G file in seconds
* and can be converted to data.frame()

# 27/10/2025
# crashed RStudio: getting alpha from bismark meth extract
* WGBS is a lot bigger than nanopore
* and this was still on chr22
* solution: data.table for everything - no more dplyr and mutate
