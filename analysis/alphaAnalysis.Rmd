# distribution of read lengths
```{r}
all_samples %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log2(read_length), colour = type, group = sample)) +
  geom_density()

  geom_violin()
```

# dsitribution of alpha values

```{r}
all_samples %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = alpha, colour = type, group = sample)) +
  geom_density()


all_samples %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sample, y = alpha, fill = type)) +

* plot 1 is how many patterns have the same length? 2 patterns of length 1: either C or T etc (pattern length is same as number of cpgs in read)
* plot 2 is sum of the occurence of that pattern length
```{r}
all_samples %>% group_by(meth_pattern) %>% summarise(n=n(), length_pat = nchar(meth_pattern)) %>% distinct() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% group_by(length_pat) %>% summarise(n_length = n(), sum_length = sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = length_pat, y = n_length)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,100)) +
  labs(title = "zoom in on plot 1")
```
```{r}
summary(all_samples$total)
summary(unique(all_samples$total))

summary(nchar(all_samples$meth_pattern))
summary(unique(nchar(all_samples$meth_pattern)))
```
* see total (num cpgs in read) as same as length of pattern

```{r}
all_samples %>% group_by(meth_pattern, total, type) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% group_by(type) %>% mutate(prop_pattern_in_type = n/sum(n)) %>% .[order(.$prop_pattern_in_type, decreasing = TRUE),]
```
* the highest proportion of patterns are basically the same for healthy and luad

* only use patterns with at least 3 cpgs
```{r}
all_samples %>% group_by(meth_pattern, total, type) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% filter(total >= 3) %>% group_by(type) %>% mutate(prop_pattern_in_type = n/sum(n)) %>% .[order(.$prop_pattern_in_type, decreasing = TRUE),]
```
```{r}
all_samples %>% filter(meth_pattern == "CCC")
```

```{r}
all_samples %>% filter(total >= 3, total <= 10) %>% distinct(meth_pattern, alpha)
```

* what am I trying to do?
* was it like the entropy thing? because that would be in a region and then looking at what patterns occur
* I guess was also wondering what patterns occur the most - and if there were any cancer specific

```{r}
overlap_bins_reads %>% filter(bin_num == 3780) %>% group_by(meth_pattern, total) %>% summarise(num_times = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% mutate(prop = num_times/sum(num_times)) %>% .[order(.$prop, decreasing = TRUE),]
```

```{r}
overlap_bins_reads %>% filter(bin_num == 3780) %>% group_by(meth_pattern, total, alpha, type) %>% summarise(num_times = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% group_by(type) %>% mutate(prop = num_times/sum(num_times)) %>% .[order(.$prop, decreasing = TRUE),]
```
* maybe question is: what are the alphas of the meth patterns that occur most frequently?
* and are they more centered at 0 and 1 than the least frequent meth patterns?

```{r}
overlap_bins_reads %>% filter(bin_num == 3780) %>% group_by(meth_pattern, total, alpha, type) %>% summarise(num_times = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% group_by(type) %>% mutate(prop = num_times/sum(num_times)) %>% .[order(.$prop, decreasing = TRUE),] %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = alpha, y = prop, colour = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```
* yes - highest props are at 0 and 1 and then 0.5

* but this is likely biased to meth pattern =0/1 because only a c or a t

* at least 3 cpg on read 

```{r}
overlap_bins_reads %>% filter(bin_num == 3780, total >= 3) %>% group_by(meth_pattern, total, alpha, type) %>% summarise(num_times = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% group_by(type) %>% mutate(prop = num_times/sum(num_times)) %>% .[order(.$prop, decreasing = TRUE),] %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = alpha, y = prop, colour = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```
* props change quite a bit
* is this interesting? - no clue
```{r}
all_samples
```


```{r}
all_samples %>% group_by(meth_pattern, type, sample) %>% summarise(n=n())
```

#

* can't remember what alicia was talking about
* it was something to do with an average
* but alpha is already basically an average as well as prop (if you say meth is 1 and unmeth is 0 - you count the meth and divide by total)
* oh it was a per position thing - like each site has a value that is the average of the alphas that span the site
* we wanted to then compare it to beta - except something is wrong with beta

```{r}
cg_sites
```


```{r}
av_alpha <- all_samples %>% separate_rows(genom_positions, sep = ",")
```

```{r}
av_alpha %>% group_by(genom_positions) %>% summarise(av_alpha = mean(alpha), median_alpha = median(alpha), sd_alpha = sd(alpha))
```
* I need the betas to compare against
```{r}
all_samples
```
