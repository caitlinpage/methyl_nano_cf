Welcome to my research website.

[Data](00_ObtainData.html)

[Overview of data files and their features](overviewFiles.html)

# exploratory initial work

[exploratory plots](exploratory_plots.html)

[explore relationship with genes](exploratory_plots_genes.html)


[same plots with cancer sample](healthyVsLuad.html)

[analysis conducted in 2 day research sprint](researchSprint.html)
[analysis continued (bins, genes, cpg features)](researchSprintB.html)

[binning the genome](binningGenome.html)

[coverage and beta distrib](coverageAndSummaryAnalysis.html)

## newer analysis (ie slightly more organised)

# alpha only

[how I get the alphas](modkitOutputToReadFormat.html)

[analysis of alpha values](alphaAnalysis.html)

[what reads should be filtered out?](filteringReads.html)

# how do I get beta values? - the problem

[trying to plot alpha and beta together](plotAlphaAndBeta.html)
* discovered a problem - expanded on in next 2
[something weird happening with alpha and beta - mostly beta](checkAlphaAndBetaMatch.html)
* most obvious example was chr22"18895995
* my indiv reads: 2 reads: 1 meth, 1 unmeth - so beta should be 0.5
* but in bedgraph file from paper: beta = 1

* I think I overcomplicated this
* I think it is actually b/c one of those reads was low probability
* which means it was filtered out (not flipped or anything else)
* so then there is just 1 methylated read - therefore beta = 1

* (I need to test this obviously)


[how I'm getting the beta values](bedFileBetas.html)

[How I'm going to join alpha and beta together](joinAlphaAndBeta.html)
* this is going to be the fixed neat version

## want to do stuff about methylation patterns - like the pat file
* but also about things like comethylation, epialleles, haplotypes
* all those kinds of metrics

* it's not really the priority but it could become part of it if there are things that are different between conditions

* started this a bit in [analysis of alpha files](alphaAnalysis.html)
* but new idea means new file (or groups of files)

* start these files with prefix mp (for meth pattern)

[initial analysis (some copied from alphaAnalysis)](mp1_methPattern.html)

* files/analysis to do
* genomic context: where are the patterns
* pete thesis package mtuples
* co-methylation
* epiallele
* entropy
* haplotype
* basically at least 1 file for the different methods - and try people's software
