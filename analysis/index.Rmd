Welcome to my research website.

[Data](00_ObtainData.html)

[exploratory plots](exploratory_plots.html)

[explore relationship with genes](exploratory_plots_genes.html)


[same plots with cancer sample](healthyVsLuad.html)

[analysis conducted in 2 day research sprint](researchSprint.html)
[analysis continued (bins, genes, cpg features)](researchSprintB.html)

[binning the genome](binningGenome.html)

[coverage and beta distrib](coverageAndSummaryAnalysis.html)

## newer work

[analysis of alpha values](alphaAnalysis.html)

[what reads should be filtered out?](filteringReads.html)

[something weird happening with alpha and beta - mostly beta](checkAlphaAndBetaMatch.html)


## want to do stuff about methylation patterns - like the pat file
* but also about things like comethylation, epialleles, haplotypes
* all those kinds of metrics

* it's not really the priority but it could become part of it if there are things that are different between conditions

* started this a bit in [analysis of alpha files](alphaAnalysis.html)
* but new idea means new file (or groups of files)

* start these files with prefix mp (for meth pattern)

[initial analysis (some copied from alphaAnalysis)](mp1_methPattern.html)

* files/analysis to do
* genomic context: where are the patterns
* pete thesis package mtuples
* co-methylation
* epiallele
* entropy
* haplotype
* basically at least 1 file for the different methods - and try people's software
